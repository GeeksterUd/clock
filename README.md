i created three files in html i created a div inside which i created four divs each to show hours, minutes, seconds and am or pm in css file i gave the styling to the html in javascript file i get the hour,minutes, seconds and am or pm  element by using get element by id then i created a function clock inside which i created a hour,minutes, seconds variable to store the time to get the time i used newDate().gethours ,.getminutes and getseconds which will give me the current time then i created a variable which store string am then i check if the hour value is greater than 12 , then  i subtract the hour value by 12 to show time in 12hour format and change the am value to pm then i used ternary operators on hours,minutes, seconds so that i can add 0 before if the vaue is in single digit 
then to show the values i used .innertext then i created a set timeout function which runs a function1000ms = 1  second i use this method to update the code every second
